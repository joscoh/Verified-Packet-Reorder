# Verified TCP Packet Reordering

Verification of TCP packet reordering from [libflowmanager](https://github.com/wanduow/libflowmanager) with minor changes to code for verification purposes (documented in code). Some small dependencies from [libtrace](https://research.wand.net.nz/software/libtrace.php) are also included and modified similarly.
